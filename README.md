# Dynamic-routing-with-minimized-regenerators-and-minimized-regerations-at-each-regnerator-node-in translucent WDM optical networks
- In this paper we have proposed routing algorithms for translucent networks in a dynamic lightpath allocation environment in which requests for communication arrive continuously. In response to each request for communication, the objective is to establish, if possible, a path, from the source to the destination of the request for communication, so that a lightpath may be established, using the path that requires the fewest stages of regeneration.
- In practical transparent networks, a lightpath must satisfy the wavelength continuity constraint. However, in a translucent network, this constraint can be relaxed at the regeneration points. 
- We have proposed an Integer Linear Program, to give the optimum results for small networks, as well as an efficient heuristic for this problem that works for larger networks. We have evaluated the heuristic through extensive simulations to establish that the heuristic produces close-to-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for the optimal solutions.

## Improvement done
- Different from the previous works in this domain, this approach also reduces the number of regnerations at each regenerator node, thus minimizing the complexity and overhead at each regenerator. Rather the load is distributed uniformly over all regenerators. 

## Future Work
- A research paper is in progress based on this work, to be shortly submitted in international SCi journal.
